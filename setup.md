# Setup
-------------------------

Marketing Mix Model fitting and evaluation. Fit estimators and wrappers, general diagnostics, validation and performance evaluation &amp; model attribution review tools.

## A. Model Fitting, Tuning & Diagnostics

### Fit estimators and Wrappers
1. OLS Estimator core functions
2. Auto-Regressive error adjustment 
3. Iterative fitting with outlier treatment
4. Alternative methods & estimators
 a) Robust Estimators S, M & MM
 b) TBD Bootstrapped Estimators & CI's

### General Diagnostics
Linear models diagnostic plots
1. Evaluation of normality assumptions 
3. Residuals and homoscedasticity: Graphical & Inferential tests
4. Partial correlations, beta weights and CIâ€™s
5. VIF & Multicollinearity
6. Added Variable Plots
7. Influence, Leverage & Outliers

## B. Model Attribution & Performance

### Model Specification & Performance Evaluation
1. Predictive performance evaluation
2. Cross-validation - traditional, time-scoping, grouped
3. Coef and CI's stability tests

### Attribution Review & Validation
1. Obtain model attribution values through scoring
2. Create amz <-> model comparisons and ratios
3. Time series overlays of attribution by variable
4. Group level attribution performance analysis
5. Partial Plots & attribution specific diagnostics


## C. Feature Engineering. Secondary Fits (cpc curves, decays) & Reporting 

### Decays & Feature Engineering
1. Generate decay variables
 a) From custom exp decay specification
 b) From pre-computed rates
2. WIP: Decay detection fit and tuning 
3. Dichotomous coding
4. Transformations (log, logit, ranks, boxcox)
5. Time range trends detection

### Cost Curve Fitting and Tests
1. Fit CPC curves using the CostCurve package methods
2. Iterative fits and tests

### Output Utilities
Includes basic tools for:
1. Merging design matrix, predictions and contrasts with full data.
2. Formatting fit summary outputs. Mainly html & kable formats.

### Layouts
There are currently two layouts: `default` and `full`.
In the `default` layout a sidebar containing navigation is present whereas in `full` layout the full page is reserved for page content.
The `full` layout can be selected by adding a yaml front matter to the markdown/html file:
```
---
layout: full
---
```

## Adding links to the navigation bar
The navigation bar can be controlled by modifying the `_config.yml` file.
Under navigation enter the title you would like to see on the sidebar and enter the relative link to that page.

## More customization
Take a look at minimal theme page to see all the theme options: [click here](https://pages-themes.github.io/minimal/).

**Serving from the `docs` folder**
> You can also serve the website from the `docs` folder. This is especially useful for project pages to keep the website files and project files separate. You basically need to keep all the files for the webpage in a folder named `docs` and in step 2 under `source` select `master branch/docs folder`.
